# Floating Route Marker

A floating route map marker is used to annoate a route line on a map.

## When to use

Use a floating route marker when showcasing a polyline such as a route. For example, a floating route marker may be used to annotate a choice between multiple routes during navigation.

## Guidelines

### General

- The anchor of a floating route marker anchor can live on the diagonal edges of the marker or the horizontal and vertical center edges of the marker.
- A floating route marker without a label can only have one icon. Do not use both a `startEnhancer` and an `endEnhancer` if there is no label.

## Examples
